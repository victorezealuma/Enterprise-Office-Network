**Issues Encountered and how they were Fixed as well as lesssons Learnt**

**1. DHCP Assignment Issue in Office A**

**Problem:**
Client devices in Network A received an IP address but had no default gateway, resulting in traffic being unroutable outside the local subnet.
**Cause:**
The DHCP pool on Server-A did not have the correct default gateway configured.
**Fix:**
Updated the DHCP pool to include 192.168.10.1 as the default gateway and renewed the DHCP lease on affected clients.
**Lesson Learned:**
Learnt that a missing default gateway in DHCP configuration prevents inter-network and internet communication.

**2. Inter-LAN Communication Works but No Internet Access**

**Problem:**
Devices in both Office A and Office B could communicate with each other, but could not reach external networks.
**Cause:**
Incorrect connector type and cable were used between the edge router and ISP router, causing WAN traffic to fail.
**Fix:**
Replaced the incorrect cable with the appropriate serial/straight-through connection and verified interface status.
**Lesson Learnt:**
Physical layer issues can mimic routing or NAT problems and should always be checked early during troubleshooting.

**3. Incorrect Default Route on Edge Router**

**Problem:**
Traffic from internal networks did not reach the ISP router.
**Cause:**
Default route was either missing or pointed to an incorrect next-hop IP.
**Fix:**
Configured a correct default route pointing to the ISP router (203.0.113.1).
**Lesson Learned:**
Default routing is essential for internet-bound traffic.
